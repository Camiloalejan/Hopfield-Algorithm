# Hopfield-Algorithm

The Hopfield Algorithm is an Associative Neural Network, and contains recurrent neurons that can be fully connected.

In this project, I used the algorithm to make an association between several images. Those images will contain some noise and we expect to get the image we choose previously.

The Hopfield.m file where trained with several images at the same time, but I added a slightly noise compared to the included noise in Hopfield2.m, but, in this case we can only use two images to train the ANN and get the desired results as we can see below.
